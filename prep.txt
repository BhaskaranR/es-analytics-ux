Manager Introduction

“Next, Bhaskar will walk us through how we’re analyzing our 2024 survey feedback using Elasticsearch.
He has migrated over 1 million survey responses, along with more than 300 word groups and 4,000+ rules defined in 2024.
All of this has been brought into Elasticsearch to classify themes with precision.
Bhaskar, over to you.”

Your Part
Opening

“Thanks. I’ll quickly explain how our Topics, Rules, and Word Groups work together to classify survey feedback at scale before we jump into the UI.”

1. Topics — The Highest Level

“We organize everything into Topics such as Client Onboarding, Retention, Loyalty, and Support.
Each Topic contains multiple rules because people describe the same idea in many different ways.”

2. Rules — The Pattern Matching Logic

“Inside a Topic, we have Rules.
Topic rules help us identify patterns in survey feedback by looking for specific keywords within a defined word range.

A rule can contain:

Plain keywords

Word Groups (macros)

Or a combination of both

Examples include:

account setup

#bacghr_client NEAR onboarding WITHIN 20 words

client AND #bacghr_support

#bacghr_career OR promotion”

3. Word Groups — Our Synonym Buckets

“To keep rules consistent, we use Word Groups — synonym sets like:

#bacghr_client → client, customer, user

#bacghr_onboarding → onboarding, induction, orientation

When a group is updated, every rule using that group improves automatically.”

4. How It Looks in the UI
Left Panel — Rules List

“On the left, we display all 4,000+ rules.
Each rule shows:

This Rule Only — exclusive matches

All Matches — total matches including overlaps”

Right Panel — Response Preview

“When we select a rule, the right panel shows real survey responses:

Highlighted matching words or synonyms

Multiple examples for context

A validation question: ‘Should this be captured?’ – Yes / No

This helps us refine rule accuracy before using it across the full dataset.”

Closing

“In summary, using Topics → Rules → Word Groups, we’ve built a scalable framework in Elasticsearch to interpret over a million 2024 survey responses.
The UI allows fast validation and ensures consistency and accuracy across all themes.

Happy to take questions.”
